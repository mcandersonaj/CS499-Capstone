# Databases: Artifact Three CS340

This artifact was from the CS340 class and was created in November of 2024. This artifact was for an Animal shelter that took breeds of cats and dogs. The artifact took the data from the shelters and input it into a database which would then be queried to see certain information on the animals in it. This data could then be used to figure out which animals could be used for training purposes for certain rescue activities. These activities would give certain requirements like age, breed, and gender and the artifact would output the animals that met these requirements.
