# CS499-Capstone

## Introduction
My name is AJ McAnderson and I have been a student at SNHU since 2023. I have been in the computer science program since joining SNHU. During my time in the program I have learned many different skills and techniques that I have used to do a number of different projects. Here I will discuss three different projects and the changes I have made to them to show what I have learned from the program.
